This is my final programming assignment for Python programming at BU

## User Story: 
As a user, I would like to keep track of the different beers that I try because I am passionate about craft beer. 
I would like to be able to input key information about each beer for later recall, and be able to query the tracker for my top beers by rating, type, and search for beers by name. 
I would also like to be able to input and export my data from the tracker from a flat file (csv).

* container type (list, tuple, set, or dictionary)
